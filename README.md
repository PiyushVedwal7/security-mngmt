Project Overview
The Kafka-Based Emergency Alert System is designed to simulate the generation and handling of various types of alerts (fire, emergency, security, and traffic). It uses Kafka for real-time data streaming, MongoDB for persistent storage of alerts, and Python for the implementation of producer and consumer scripts.

This system aims to provide a flexible and scalable solution for real-time alert handling, making it useful for schools, businesses, and public safety organizations.

Technologies Used
Apache Kafka: For streaming data between producers and consumers.
MongoDB: For storing alert data persistently.
Python: For writing producer and consumer scripts.
Kafka-Python: Python client for Kafka.
Pymongo: Python client for MongoDB
